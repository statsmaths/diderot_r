% From the catalog:

% \begin{quote}
% Topics will include exploratory data analysis, correlation, linear
% and multiple regression, design of experiments, basic probability,
% the normal distribution, sampling distributions, estimation,
% hypothesis testing and randomization approach to inference.
% Exploratory graphical methods, model building and model checking
% techniques will be emphasized with extensive use of statistical
% software for data analysis.

% % If you are here because you have been dying to hear about
% % the randomization approach to inference \magenta{that's great}!

% % \pause But, let's be honest, I assume many of you are taking
% % an introductory statistics course because its a prerequisite
% % for your major, required for graduate school, or strongly
% % recommended for continued study in some area of interest to
% % you. \pause \magenta{That's great too!}

% \stitle{Course materials:}

% Nearly all of the materials we use in this class will be posted on blackboard.

% \end{frame}


% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

% \stitle{Final grades:}

% Every graded work in this course will be scored on a $4$ point scale,
% roughly corresponding to the $4.0$ GPA grading scheme. Your final grade
% will be calculated by taking the weighted average of all of assignments
% as follows:
% \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
% \item Quizzes 20\% (best 8 of 10; 2.5\% each)
% \item Midterms 20\% (10\% each)
% \item Data analyses 30\% (10\% each)
% \item Final 30\%
% \end{itemize}
% Final grades are determined by reading off the weighted average score
% from a table matching these to letter grades.

% \end{frame}

% \stitle{Final grades (cont.):}

% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{c || c}
% Numeric Average & \multicolumn{1}{| c}{Final Grade} \\
% \hline \hline
% 3.80 to 4.00 & A   \\
% 3.50 to 3.79 & A-  \\
% 3.20 to 3.49 & B+  \\
% 2.80 to 3.19 & B   \\
% 2.50 to 2.79 & B-  \\
% 2.20 to 2.49 & C+  \\
% 1.80 to 2.19 & C   \\
% 1.50 to 1.79 & C-  \\
% 0.00 to 1.49 & F
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% Any grades on the boundaries (i.e., $3.794$) will be rounded up
% to the nearest second decimal place.

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

% \stitle{Quizzes:}

% There will be $10$ short quizzes given during the semester. These will
% be at the end of class on Tuesdays, for weeks 2-12 (one week is missing
% for Fall break). All will consist of $4$ questions, such as
% True/False, multiple choice, and matching.

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

% \stitle{Midterms and Finals:}

% We will have two midterms and one final exam. The format for all three
% will consist of completing a short data analysis using R on the computers
% in our classroom lab. You may use any external references during the exam,
% and I will provide documentation (and possibly the data itself) for the datasets
% ahead of the exam to allow you to jump right in from the start.

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

% \stitle{Midterms and Finals (cont.):}

% The dates for the exams are:
% \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
% \item Midterm I: 2016-09-29
% \item Midterm II: 2016-11-17
% \item Final: 2016-12-12 (section 02) or 2016-12-13 (section 03)
% \end{itemize}
% The first will cover the basics of data manipulation and visualization. The
% second exam and final will also cover basic statistical inference and modeling.
% I plan to allow students the option of taking the final exam at an alternative
% time or in the other section's slot.

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

% \stitle{Data analyses:}

% We will also have three data analysis reports due throughout the semester. The planned
% due dates for these are as follows, though these may end up being moved slightly:
% \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
% \item 2016-09-15
% \item 2016-11-03
% \item 2016-12-02
% \end{itemize}
% The format will be similar to the exams, where you are given a dataset and some
% leading questions to answer, but will be completed out of class.
% As these are not completed under any time pressure, the level of polish should exceed
% that of the exams.

% \end{frame}


% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

% \stitle{Late Policy:}

% Students are expected to submit work in on-time and to take quizzes when they
% are scheduled. If there are any issues with this, please let me know as soon
% as possible. I will only accept late assignments in the event of exceptional
% circumstances (such as extended absences or family emergencies). There are no
% make-up exams.

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

% \stitle{Class Participation:}

% This course will be very interactive. Your attendance in class and
% full engagement with the material are both expected, though you will
% not be penalized for missing class unless (following a warning) they
% become excessive. This may result in a grade of V.

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

% \stitle{Special approval requests:}

% If you have special approval forms for extra time on exams or any other
% special circumstances, please speak with me as early as possible.

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

% \stitle{Academic Integrity:}

% Cheating and plagiarism are grave scholarly offenses and potential grounds
% for expulsion; they are also a major barrier to your intellectual development.
% You are expected to familiarize yourself with the entirety of the
% University of Richmond’s Honor Code. If you are confused or unsure about
% appropriate citation protocol or any other aspect of the Honor code,
% please consult me before turning in an assignment.

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

% \stitle{Data collection:}

% From time to time, I will be collecting data from the class either through
% online polls or live in class. I try my best to ask questions that are neither
% overly personal or sensitive. If at any point you ever feel uncomfortable
% answering something, however, feel free to `pass' or simply make up an answer.

\stitle{First Half}

\begin{itemize}
\item `labs': daily work to be handed in on box before the next
  class period; graded on pass/fail scale

  labs

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

\stitle{Second Half}

You will complete $4$ additional data analyses.
These analyses will come from one of six \textit{thematic
tracts}:

\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item public policy
\item spatial analysis
\item healthcare and sciences
\item sports
\item business
\item culture
